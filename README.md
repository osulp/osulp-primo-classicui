Primo Alma Mashup Styling
=========================
Within Primo, when you click certain tabs (Item Details, Availability & Request Options, etc.) Alma 'mashups' are loaded into internal frames. These load Alma data with CSS separate from Primo, using a 'branding skin' ZIP file containing CSS and icon image files.

These files are in the `branding_skin` folder (the important one being `branding_skin/css/mashup.css`). To upload to Alma, they need to be zipped up into a file called **skin.zip** with all of the files and folder structure intact. The upload location in Alma is **General Configuration > Configuration Menu > Branding/Logo > Delivery System Skins**

Initial configuration is required to tell Primo to use this Alma skin in the delivery tabs. More details are in the PowerPoint presentation from 10/19/14 from Bill Kelm at Willamette on the Alliance training page.
